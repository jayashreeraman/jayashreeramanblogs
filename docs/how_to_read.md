# How To Read (aka Strategies to reduce Grad/Adult Life Struggles)

### As someone who started (or transitioned) to reading more non-fiction than fiction, I have been struggling with not being able to quantify the essence of all the papers and non-fiction books I've been reading off late. With non-fiction, you don't have to stay committed to serial page-turning, and for a knowledge (or information) hungry noob like yours truly, it is the equivalent of a kid let loose in a candy store. 

### I have been struggling to have a more disciplined approach towards non-fiction and academic papers, and this book [http://utminers.utep.edu/trcurry/howtoread.pdf] by Paul N. Edwards, from the University of Michigan's School of Information is a great help. 

### Some excerpts (notes to myself):

- How can you learn the most from a book when you are reading for information rather than for pleasure?
- NEVER read a non-fiction book from the beginning to the end.
- Your time is LIMITED
- *Remember and record* the main points.
- Figure out **why** you are reading this book/paper
- Four things: who is the author, what is the **argument**, what is the **evidence**, what is the **conclusion**?
- Imagine that you are going to review the book for a magazine
- Read it **three** times: Overview (discovery) 1/10th the total time, Detail (understanding) - 6/10ths the total time, Notes (recall) - 3/10ths the total time
- The **Hourglass Information Structure**
- Personal Text Markup Language
- Knowing who wrote a book helps you judge its quality and understand its full significance. __Check the acknowledgements and bibliography always__
- A book is always partly a response to other writers
- Use your **unconscious mind**: several short sessions rather than one long marathon
- Don't just contemplate privately, discuss it with others, bring it up in classes, write about it
